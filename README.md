# Xcode Developer Disk Image for iOS 4.2 and Above

# Why We need disk images?
When your apple device got upgraded to new OS, the current XCode version you have used doesn't have the appropriate disk image for that OS version. This prevents you to push the build to the device.

# Where to put the new disk images?
Go to your XCode app in the Application folder, open its content and locate the appropriate platform which you're going to add the new disk image.
Path: `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport`
